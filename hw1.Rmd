```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This homework is more or less a tutorial that helps you set up the coding environment used in this course, and familiarizes you with the format of the assignment submission. 
As a pre-requisite of this homework, first install R, and then the RStudio (the free version of Rstudio Desktop). 

Please respond to all questions. If the question asks you to do something on your laptop and you have finished that, just say "Done". 

1. Create a folder named `ds202_hw1`, and **either** create an RMarkDown file `hw1.Rmd` under this folder **or** move the provided template into this folder. `hw1.Rmd` will include your solutions. The file and folder names are *case-sensitive*, which means `hw1.Rmd` and `HW1.rmd` are different. *It is crucial to follow the exact folder structure and file names* in this course, so that your homework can be reproduced. The correct folder structure is

    ```
    ds202_hw1
    |-- hw1.Rmd
    |-- hw1.html (generated after knitting)
    ```
    
    Answer: Done (Note that the start of your answer on the next line must be indented. In other words, don't remove the leading spaces.)

2. Write your name in the YAML of your homework `Rmd` file.

    Answer: Done

3. Write a paragraph to introduce yourself. Set your name in bold font and your major in italic. 

    Answer:  
    Hello everyone, my name is **Brandon Rouse** and I am majoring in  *Data Science* and *Communication Studies* here at Iowa State. I am currently a sophomore and have a variety of hobbies that I like to do while at school. I like to do anything outdoors, but more specifically I like to longboard, walk my dog, and go on hikes. I am a huge sports fan. I love both college and NBA basketball. Unfortunately, I can’t attend any Iowa State games this year due to Covid, but they aren’t doing well anyway so I’m not missing out on much. I am also a fan of baseball and football, but I don’t stay as updated as I do with basketball. I am a very laid back person and like to watch movies and listen to Joe Rogan podcasts. I am looking forward to a great semester and meeting new people. 
  
4. Write a paragraph describing a job that you think is related to data science. Include a hyperlink and an image. Make sure your answer is in a nice format to read. 

    Answer:  
    One job that I think deals a lot with data science is being apart of the retail sales team for a grocery store. Grocery stores have one objective: sell products to maximize profit. Looking deeper into the data from a specific store can greatly help the management maximize profit. Grocery stores are incredibly seasonal. Different products get sold at different rates depending on the time of year. Hamburgers and hotdogs fly off the shelves during the summer, but chili and canned soup take over during the winter. Being able to break down the sales would help stores better prepare for the high demand for the products. This would allow for the store to order more product ahead of time, usually costing less money than if they ordered when they needed it. Having enough product allows workers to build huge, eye-catching displays to sell the product even faster. Also, data science can help stores find which way of selling their products works best. Many companies have formed a way to order your products online and pick them up when you get to the store. Is this method more effective than customers walking through the store? Should the store focus more on online ordering? All of these questions can be answered by breaking down the data and finding the answers. A great team of data scientists can drastically increase the profit margin of a company.

5. What data topic will you be most interested in? (Optional) Provide a source of such dataset if you have.

    Answer:  
    Overall, I am most interested in data revolving around sports. I have always been a sports fan and figuring out how sports analysts find and interpret all of their data has always been interesting to me. Figuring out the favorites to win a game, the calculations that go into the spread of a game, and just finding the overall performance of athletes seems very interesting and complicated. Just working with sports data and starting to find/make my own conclusions will greatly help me figure out what goes on behind the scenes. Since I have such a large passion for sports, this will be the data topic that I will be most interested in. Last semester my group and I did a project on college basketball in DS 201. We found a lot of interesting data on the website **Kaggle**.
  
6. To check that your R and Rstudio installation is correct, find the version of R by entering `version` into the R console. Include this command into a R code trunk in your solution `Rmd` file to have it automatically printed in the knitted html file. 

    Answer:  
    ```{r}
    version
    ```
  
7. Install git. 
    - If you are on Windows: 
        a. Install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/). In the coming weeks we will use the Git Bash (but not the Git GUI). 
        b. After installation, set up Rstudio to use Git bash as the shell for the Terminal: Open RStudio, click Tools--Global Options--Terminal; under **Shells**, select Git Bash; click OK. 
        c. In the main menu of RStudio: click Tools--Terminal--New Terminal. If you have a `$` before your prompt, then you should be good to go.
    - If you are on Linux or macOS, Git has probably been installed by default, so you do not need to install anything. Just click the Terminal tab (above the R Console).

    Answer: Done
  
8. What is the version of your Git? To find out, go to the Terminal tab in RStudio (right to the Console tab), and type in the following command. If it works, this shows that the setup of your terminal and Git is correct. 
<!-- Then explore the bash command line and Git. -->

    ```
    git --version
    ```

    Answer:  
    git version 2.23.0
  
9. Configure your git username and user email by modifying and entering the following commands into the terminal

    ```
    git config --global user.name "your first and last name"
    git config --global user.email "yourEmail"
    ```

    Answer: Done
  

10. Register a [GitHub](https://www.github.com) account. What is your username?
